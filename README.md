Methods for the alignment and merging of partially or inexactly aligned
data.

## Important

**align** was renamed/repackaged as **alignment** after 2025-05-25. The
v.0.0.7 package is retained here for anyone still using related
code/method.

Users wanting most recent code should check out
<https://karlropkins.github.io/alignment/>

Currently, not aware of any issues transitioning from **align** to
**alignment**, but anyone with any problems with the newer package,
please get in contact…

## Installation

You can install the development version of **align** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/).

(As well as `R`, the package also includes some `c++` code. So, if you
have not used similar before you may need to install a compiler, for
example [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) if you
are using Windows).

``` r
install.packages("devtools") #if you don't already have it
devtools::install_github("KarlRopkins/align")
```

conduct but are not strict as them regarding coding style…
