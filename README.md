# align

Methods for the alignment and merging of partially or inexactly aligned
data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of align from
[GitHub](https://github.com/).

(As well as `R`, the package also includes some `c++` code. So, if you
have not used similar before you may need to install a compiler, for
example [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) if you
are using Windows).

``` r
install.packages("devtools") #if you don't already have it
devtools::install_github("KarlRopkins/align")
```
